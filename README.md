Blog Built with Flask.

Personally I prefer Python programming to JavaScript.
That is why I tried to also do Web Development on top of Python.
I built this blog site to learn development with Flask.

It works really well, but I do like React better.
It would be easy if I could just use one programming language for everything.

As it stands it seems I will continue to use:
- Python for Data Analysis
- JavaScript for Web Development
